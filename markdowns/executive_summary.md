Sustainable Denim: Consumer Insights & Behavioral Barriers to Adoption

ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary

Purpose of the study
This exploratory study investigates consumer behavior related to denim jeans purchases, with a specific focus on sustainability preferences, and barriers to adoption. The analysis draws on survey data from 462 self-selected respondents and aims to identify actionable insights that can inform more effective sustainable fashion strategies.

Key insights at a glance 
 
â€¢	Durability is the top priority: Consumers value jeans that last, making durability a key selling point for sustainable denim jeans.
â€¢	Low awareness is the biggest barrier: A majority of non-adopters cite lack of knowledge or clarity about where and how to find sustainable jeans.
â€¢	Half of respondents are brand-uncertain: 50% are unsure about what type of denim brand they buyâ€”indicating a wide-open opportunity for influence.
â€¢	Sustainable adoption varies by age: Younger consumers (18â€“25) are more loyal to fast fashion, while older and mid-aged groups are more open to sustainable alternatives.
â€¢	In-store shopping still matters: Despite the rise of e-commerce, most consumers still prefer physical stores or hybrid channels for denim jeans.

Relevance for Industry
Understanding the behavioral drivers and barriers behind denim purchases is essential for brands seeking to accelerate the adoption of sustainable fashion. This research shows that the primary obstacles to sustainable denim are not fixed attitudes, but knowledge and accessibility gaps -both of which are solvable with better design, labeling, pricing strategies, and retail experiences. Brands that focus on educating uncertain consumers, emphasizing value-per-wear, and offering hybrid sustainable collections under familiar labels stand to gain trust and market share in an increasingly eco-conscious landscape.
